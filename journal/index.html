                    <p>Modals remind me of the multiple pop-up windows that appear everytime I used to stream a movie. The first type that pops in mind when I think about modals are the ones in commercial websites that ask you to give your email address for a 10% discount or the privilege of receiving 10 more emails a day. Why would I give my information even before seeing the products? By 2013, I’ve unknowingly adapted the habit of searching and clicking the “X” button without even reading the text. In my work, I will probably avoid using modals as much as possible because I’ve experienced myself how it negatively affects the flow of a user experience.</p>

                    <p>Form is one of the most used ways of receiving information from users. Therefore, form design plays an important role in making sure the process is straightforward, easy, and not frustrating. From the article, some tips stand out to me as I remembered circumstances where they were not followed which negatively affected my experience.</p>

                    <p>First, I strongly agree with tip number six about explaining any input or formatting requirements. To register for some websites, I’ve changed the special character in my password as sometimes they don’t allow certain special characters like the dot. However, I often completely forget that I’ve altered my password to fit the website’s standard and it’s often not specified when you signed in again. I think including formatting requirements for sign in pages will decrease the times I reset my password.</p>

                    <p>Second, I agree with placeholder text (tip number 8) hurting the usability of a form, especially for government websites where you have to put document information that has a distinct sequence of numbers and letters. Many times I had to do research to make sure I put the right information and in the right format, as sometimes you have to omit the initial characters of an identification number.</p>

                    <p>The Behance sign up page follows best practices of form design like explaining any input or formatting requirements, one column layout, the label’s position and proximity, and auto-focus for input fields.</p>
