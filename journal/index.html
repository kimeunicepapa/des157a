                    <p>This flower shaped earring is part of my collection and I bought it in a street stall in Italy. The image shows one of the many pairs of earrings I own which are all purchased from different countries. My collection showcases my love for travel, fashion, handcrafted items, and search for distinct colors or shapes.</p>

                    <p>The image shows two people skydiving, including my classmate Satomi. The location looks like Davis. The most interesting aspects of this image are the leading lines of the fields that lead to the two subjects, and the patterns created by the farming land and the clouds. The most obvious aspect is that the people are definitely flying. The most mysterious part, on the other hand, is who took the picture? </p>

                        <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>

                    <p>As I was reading the article, I thought I wish I analyzed pictures in high school as well. I’m a visual learner and I think close reading photographs would have helped me a lot in absorbing and ingraining the knowledge from high school. In my high school in Italy, all the history lectures about World War 2 were only taught orally, no presentation slides or pictures (except the one from the book). History for me became just a list of dates, alliances, names of countries and conflicts. Sadly, I can barely remember any of it now. If we spent some time doing close reading of photographs of that time, I think my class would have better understood the hardships of the war and sympathized with the people involved. Maybe I would remember more about a reality that is not too far from us.</p>

                    <p>In the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwards.com</a> website, I found the <a href="https://adobexbowie75.com/">Adobe X Bowie</a> website which is an interactive game where you can explore David Bowie’s dressing room and learn information about the musician. However, I prefer the <a href="https://vaultartspace.gucci.com/gallery/room">Gucci Vault Art Space</a> website in terms of animation, transition and composition. I think I’ll be implementing a similar concept for my Every Picture project.</p>

                    <p>Modals remind me of the multiple pop-up windows that appear everytime I used to stream a movie. The first type that pops in mind when I think about modals are the ones in commercial websites that ask you to give your email address for a 10% discount or the privilege of receiving 10 more emails a day. Why would I give my information even before seeing the products? By 2013, I’ve unknowingly adapted the habit of searching and clicking the “X” button without even reading the text. In my work, I will probably avoid using modals as much as possible because I’ve experienced myself how it negatively affects the flow of a user experience.</p>

                        <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Form is one of the most used ways of receiving information from users. Therefore, form design plays an important role in making sure the process is straightforward, easy, and not frustrating. From the article, some tips stand out to me as I remembered circumstances where they were not followed which negatively affected my experience.</p>

                    <p>First, I strongly agree with tip number six about explaining any input or formatting requirements. To register for some websites, I’ve changed the special character in my password as sometimes they don’t allow certain special characters like the dot. However, I often completely forget that I’ve altered my password to fit the website’s standard and it’s often not specified when you signed in again. I think including formatting requirements for sign in pages will decrease the times I reset my password.</p>

                    <p>Second, I agree with placeholder text (tip number 8) hurting the usability of a form, especially for government websites where you have to put document information that has a distinct sequence of numbers and letters. Many times I had to do research to make sure I put the right information and in the right format, as sometimes you have to omit the initial characters of an identification number.</p>
