        <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The final project will be a funky and fun gallery showcasing part of my earring collection, analyzed from a designer perspective.</p>

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>The final project will be an improvement of my Every Picture project which showcases my collection of earrings. Right now, I only have two earrings so I’m planning to add at least one more pair to the collection. In response to the feedback received, I will also include more written information about the earrings and their “stories”.  I will create a more appealing design and improve the animation. I will try to solve the glitching GIFs and the issues with the change in the composition that I’ve encountered with different viewports. If I have spare time, I’ll also include the option to zoom into the earring to allow a closer look.</p>

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>I’m planning to include a different self-portrait illustration — a front view one — to showcase two earrings instead of one. I will change the background to a neutral color to make the earrings stand out more. I’m trying to go for a maximalist design so I’m adding more graphic elements and texture taken from the earrings like color palettes or shape silhouettes. It would also be fun to change the look of each section depending on the earring. As I want it to look cohesive, I think changing the color of the type could be the element changing to not make it too overwhelming for the user.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>I’ll be keeping the scroll interaction with the appearing/disappearing earrings but I think the earrings’ animation could improve with either a delay or a different type of motion, like earrings coming from both sides to the center then exit up, out of the viewport . After the feedback assignment, I got inspired to add more texture in my project to make it look less flat, more intentional and interesting to look at. I’m thinking of including the option to see a zoomed version of the earring as it could improve the user experience and understanding of my project.</p>

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>My final project will showcase my collection of earrings with an effective and straightforward interface. The written text will be satirical content analyzing my earrings as a graphic designer. I wish my design major classmates in this class would find the content funny and relatable, and the design consistent, funky and easy to use. I plan to improve the UI of the site by adding a kind of map or overview where you can click to navigate to the specific earring without having to scroll through it. However, I’m not sure if I’ll have enough time to make all the improvements.</p>
