        <h1>User Test Results</h1>

        <h2>Introduction (copied from assignment)</h2>
        <p>During User Testing, the tester is observed testing the project with no verbal interaction with the maker. Note-taking and visual documentation are key components during user testing, as are post-testing methods of analysis, including online surveys and verbal discussions with testers, and they are essential to design and development processes.</p>

                <h2>Pre-user-testing</h2>
                <p>In preparation for the user test, I decided on asking the user to do three tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read content on the left</li>
                    <li>Look at the content on the right</li>
                    <li>Scroll to the next section</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will observe how the user will try to complete them and how he’ll interact with the site in general.</p>

                <h2>During user-testing</h2>
                <p>The user interacted with the site as expected by scrolling through the content. I noticed how the code wasn’t working properly anymore after I added the overlay for the test — the earrings wouldn’t show correctly anymore if the user scrolled up again. Another thing I noticed is how the user continued scrolling even when he reached the bottom of the page.</p>

                <h2>Post-user-testing</h2>
                <p>After the test, the user tester completed the following questionnaire:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think could be improved in terms of content?<br>More realistic illustration</br></li>
                    <li>What do you think about the color palette?<br>Unique color scheme</br></li>
                    <li>Which elements did you think could be fun to interact with?<br>T-shirt that changes based on the earrings</br></li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>With this user test, I learned that you should check thoroughly the functionality of the code to make sure it works as I originally wished as in before altering the code for the test. I noticed that it’s better to ask the post-user-testing through a quick interview rather than a questionnaire because a user might not be prone to write down their thoughts and it could avoid misunderstandings. 
                Regarding the results of the user test, I think the user completed the tasks without any issues, except for the error in the code’s functionality. After hearing the feedback, I will keep the color palette, especially the green background. Contrary to the user tester’s opinion, I will probably keep the illustration as I prefer it to a possible more realistic version. I will also try to find ways to include interactive elements and experiment with the shirt more.
