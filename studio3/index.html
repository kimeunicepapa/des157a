                <h2>Rules for the game</h2>
                <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is hopes for new sprouts. The total of the sprouts is added to the current player's score, unless either side is empty. If this happens, it means this player "accidentally" forgot to water the seeds and the turn is passed to the other player. After each leap of hope, the current player can either hope again, (assuming no side turned empty) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 30 sprouts or higher wins.</p> 
                <p>Oh, and if both sides are empty(snake eyes)that means the player forgot the seeds completely existed, and unfortunately all the previous grown sprouts died. So donâ€™t do that.</p>
